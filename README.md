  First of all, I want to be honest and tell you that Youtube helped me to finish this assignment. I dont wanna make any excuses but I want to be clear in this situation.
   When you extended the deadline I was almost done with the project, and thought everything was okay. I really worked hard for it but then I really got stuck and I messed it up.
   I didnt even know what was wrong. My IDE is not working and I honestly wanted to give my time to do the work instead of trying to fix my computer. So lastly, I watched a video and did everything step by step. I really feel like I cheated and I first didnt want to submit it but at the same time I felt like I gave so much time on it. I really wanted to come up with something awesome maybe that stressed me out. Im so sorry if I made you feel bad but trust me I really worked hard. 

   Even though I got help from Youtube I still couldnt manage to compile it. :( 
   I really had fun while working on it but not in the last days.
